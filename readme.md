## Folder structure

```
| task1
| - index.ts  // <-- implementation
| - test.ts  // <-- unit test case
| task2
| - index.ts
| - test.ts
| task3
| - index.ts
| - test.ts
| index.ts // << - Entry point
```

## Getting started

Install all the library

```
$ yarn
```

Run test

```
$ yarn test
```

Start the app, see the result

```
$ yarn start
```
The result will be in terminal console

Note: you can also modify the variable before running the function,
search for keyword "Modify" in index.ts(entry point)

About how it works
Inside each task/index.ts, the implementation, will have the comment show how it works

If still need anything, I happy to clarify
